# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
Made in HTML, CSS, and JS, Work Day Scheduler uses Bootstrap, Jquery, and Moment.JS to offer the user a clean and functional experience. Work Day Scheduler is a website that allows you to schedule each hour of your day, without missing a beat. Events scheduled for each hour are even saved between browser sessions, and even changes the color of each time block according to how much time is remaining. Regardless of your use-case, I believe Work Day Scheduler to be something you'll love.
